# Extending

this guide assumes that you are already using the basic-listeners bot

Extending is often useful to add new types to properties

```ts
//extensions/command.ts
import { NaticoCommand } from '../deps.ts';
import { BotClient } from '../mod.ts';
export class botCommand extends NaticoCommand {
	//Overwriting the old NaticoClient that was here with your custom one
	declare client: BotClient;
}
```

### Using your custom command

After extending NaticoCommand you need to import it to your commands

:::danger Make sure to import the new extension

If you dont import it the types wont work

:::

```ts
import { botCommand } from '../extensions/command.ts';
export default class listeners extends botCommand {
	constructor() {
		super('listeners', {
			name: 'listeners',
			aliases: ['listeners'],
			description: 'View the amount of listeners the bot has loaded',
		});
	}
	exec(message: discordenoMessage) {
		//Without extending this would have caused a type error
		message.reply(`Pong ${this.client.listenerHandler.modules.size} listeners`);
	}
}
```

You can find the resulting code [here](https://github.com/naticoo/examplebot/tree/main/extending)
